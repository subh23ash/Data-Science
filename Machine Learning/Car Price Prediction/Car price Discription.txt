Project Title: Car Price Prediction with Linear Regression and Matplotlib Visualization

Overview:

The Car Price Prediction project aims to develop a robust predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate the prices of cars based on their attributes. 
Leveraging preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and separate training and testing datasets, this project offers valuable insights into the factors influencing car prices in the market, 
visualized using Matplotlib.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, transforming floating-point values, and ensuring data consistency to prepare the datasets for model training and testing.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features such as car make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine capacity, 
and transmission type to improve the predictive accuracy of the model.
Linear Regression Model: Implementing the Linear Regression algorithm to build a predictive model that estimates car prices based on input features.
Separate Training and Testing Datasets: Dividing the dataset into separate training and testing subsets to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.
Predictive Insights: Analyzing the coefficients of the linear regression model to understand the impact of each feature on the predicted car prices.
Visualization with Matplotlib: Creating visualizations such as scatter plots, regression lines, and histograms to illustrate the relationship between input features and predicted car prices.
