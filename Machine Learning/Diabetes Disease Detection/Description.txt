Project Title: Diabetes Disease Detection 

Overview:The Diabetes Disease Detection Classification project aims to develop a robust machine learning model using the KNN Algorithm.
This classic dataset serves as an excellent introduction to machine learning algorithms and classification techniques.

Key Features:
Import libraries like Numpy and Pandas and convert the dataset to dataframe.
Then we check if any missing value is present, if present then fill it.
Then we separate data into training and testing using TRAIN-TEST-SPLIT funtion.
Normalization: Assigning value to a specific range
Data Preprocessing:Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data integrity.
Model Training: Implementing the K Neighbour classifier to learn the underlying patterns in the data and build a classification model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using cross-validation techniques and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Testing the model.

Benefits:

Simple yet Effective: K Neighbour Classifier is known for their simplicity and effectiveness, making them suitable for small to medium-sized datasets like diabetes.
Interpretability: K Neighbour Classifier provides transparent and interpretable results
Fast Training and Prediction: The lightweight nature of K Neighbour Classifier enables quick model training and prediction, ideal for real-time applications.

Conclusion:

The Diabetes Detection classification project using K Neighbour Classifier offers a practical introduction to classification algorithms and their application in real-world scenarios.
